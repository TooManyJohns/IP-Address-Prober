 * The PSBD Class stands for (Port Scan Database) provides a user interface to allow the firewall.log.txt file to be
 * queried. It also provides cases for what the user wants to check from the txtfile, such as described and commented with each case below
 * the only difference being this assignment uses a linkedlist that we learned in lectures
